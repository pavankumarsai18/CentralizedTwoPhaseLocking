This readme file describes the files and libraries required to run the project.
It also describes how to compile and start the project

1. Libraries required
---------------------
   a. sqlite-jdbc-3.36.03: This is the jdbc driver that connects to a sqlite database.
                           This is currently in the lib directory and named as "sqlite-jdbc.jar",
                           no need to install if the project works.

   b. rmi: Make sure that java is able to run rmi.

   c. Java: version 17.0.2

   d. Tested on macOS 12.0.1


2. How to compile and run the project
-------------------------------------
    a. First open the terminal
    b. Go to "CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking" directory
    c. Type the following command to compile
        "javac -d bin ./src/*/*.java"

    d. Now you will be able to see a directory named "bin"
    e. Go into "bin" directory by typing "cd bin"
    f. Start rmi in the bin registry by typing the following command (for mac)
        "rmiregistry &"

3. Start a central site
------------------------
    - Now open a new new terminal or a new tab in terminal and go to "CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking" directory.
    - Type the following command to start central site:
        "java -classpath bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar CentralSite.CentralSite"
    - This will start the central site. It will give u a prompt as follows:
        > Welcome!!!
        > In Central Site
        > Enter the timeout for deadlocks (in ms):

    - Now enter a number atleast greater than 3000. This number corresponds to the time after which deadlocks are checked.
        For example if I entered 3000 then I will recieve the following prompt
        > Deadlock is checked every: 3000ms
        > Enter if you wish to output to console (true/false):

    - Enter "true" to see the output false otherwise.

    - Now you have successfully started the central site.

    Example of the total run of starting central site is as follows:
    CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking % java -classpath bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar CentralSite.CentralSite
    > Welcome!!!
    > In Central Site
    > Enter the timeout for deadlocks (in ms):
    3000
    > Deadlock is checked every: 3000ms
    > Enter if you wish to output to console (true/false):
    true

4. How to start a participant (Data site)
-----------------------------------------
    - Open a new terminal. DO NOT CLOSE the previously opened terminals.
    - Type the following command to start the participant site:
        "java -classpath bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar ParticipantSite.ParticipantSite"

    - Now you will see the following prompt
        > Welcome!!!
        > In Participant Site
        > Type 'start' to start site:

    - Type 'start' Now you will see the following command
        > Enter the complete file path:

    - Enter the path to the a test files in the 'TestFiles' (such as test1.txt).
      For example the following path is to test1.txt in my computer:
        /Users/pavanvadrevu/IdeaProjects/CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking/TestFiles/test1.txt

      You can get the path by going into the TestFiles directory and using pwd command.

    - Now you have successfully started paricipant site. Open a new terminal and repeat the exact same process
     (may be except for the file path) to start other participant site.

    Example of the total run of starting participant site is as follows:
    CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking % java -classpath bin:lib/sqlite-jdbc.jar ParticipantSite.ParticipantSite
    > Welcome!!!
    > In Participant Site
    > Type 'start' to start site:
    start
    > Enter the complete file path:
    /Users/pavanvadrevu/IdeaProjects/CentralizedTwoPhaseLocking/TestFiles/test1.txt


How to stop a site:
-------------------
1. Go the terminal where the site is running and
    Press ctrl + C to kill any site. Killing the central site will cause failures.
2. This implementation is assumes that no site failures can occur.
3. To kill the rmiregistry go to the terminal and type "ps" and run "kill" command on the PID of rmiregistry.
